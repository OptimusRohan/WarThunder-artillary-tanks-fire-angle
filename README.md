# WarThunder-artillary-tanks-fire-angle
This program should give the angle to fire at when using either a M44 or M55 to hit a given target


- At the moment I am not taking air ressistance into account
- I am happy to see what other people might add
- This also assumes that you are at the same height and the person you are firing at is not moving
